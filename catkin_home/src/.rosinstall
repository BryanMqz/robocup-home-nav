# File used by the ROS command `wstool` to download packages
# that the project needs.
# http://wiki.ros.org/wstool
# 
# `wstool update -t src` automatically downloads packages listed 
# here. They will be downloaded inside a ExternalPackages/ directory;
# then, when running `catkin build`/`catkin_make`, those packages
# will be also build, included in the same workspace, and
# will be available like other packages declared there.
#
# To include a new one from the catkin_home directory run:
# `wstool set ExternalPackages/*package's-drectory-name* --git *https://link.git* --version=*vrsn* -t src`
#
# NOTE: After running a `wstool set`, please add again this comment.
